# Input-Then-Graph-Scores
Python program that reads names of golfers and their scores using 
keyboard input and saves them to two lists respectively.
The program then prints a "report" by going through the information in the lists.
"Report" has a formatted and organized output for its display, shows the average score
of the players, and generates a bar graph of the data.
